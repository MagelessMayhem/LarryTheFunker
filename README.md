# violet-funk

**Note:** This overlay's ebuilds are currently in the process of being migrated to binaries. The change will be gradual but noticeable.

Gentoo ebuild overlay based around FNF and FNF mods.

All of the ebuilds in this overlay install pre-built binaries. You do not need to worry about compiling them.

I accept (almost) any suggestions as to which mods to port and/or include in this overlay. You may open an issue with the mod to suggest ***granted it has accessible source code.*** Please include the link to the mod's source code when suggesting a mod.
